# Convert the data from Gravitus to conform to the format used by Strong

This repo contains a simple script to convert the data as exported by Gravitus to have the format of the data export from Strong. This allows to import the workouts to Hevy, as the app currently only supports importing from Strong. 

## Setup
```shell

pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook .

```

## The script
Notebook should run as-is. Modify the variables in the first cell, to match the names of your files.
